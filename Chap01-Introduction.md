To get access to the ready-made project, please use the below git repository link to clone to your local device and open with Unity.

[Github Project Repository](https://github.com/outscal/2D-Dash-Feature.git)

The repo has 2 branches - Problem-Statement and Solution-Statement, the former being the one with all the readymade projects and the latter had got the solution.

You should try building the solution yourself first, then look at the Solution-Statement for an alternative solution.

So, let's get started.
